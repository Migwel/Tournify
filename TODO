- Stop using eager fetching
- Use Flyway?
- Create docker image for easy use
- Deletion of subscription should be more secure
- Give option to use certificate for notifications
- Make communication.jar available on maven so that people can use it to handle requests and responses instead of creating objects themselves (Maybe not needed anymore now that we have a open API file)
- Generate objects automatically based on OpenAPI (Not sure if I want that. For example, Player has a method getDisplayUsername)
